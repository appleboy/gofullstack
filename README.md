Some reading from [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27446960/immutable-js-relationships]()

What I would suggest is to look at some of those projects and articles:

- Immutable React article by Peter Hausel
- Morearty.js - using immutable state in React like in Om but written in pure JavaScript
- react-cursor - functional state management abstraction for use with Facebook
- Omniscient - a library providing an abstraction for React components that allows for fast top-down rendering embracing immutable data * Om - ClojureScript interface to React
- mori - a library for using ClojureScript's persistent data structures in JavaScript
- Fluxy - an implementation of Facebook's Flux archtecture
- Facebook's Immutable - persistent data collections for JavaScript that when combined with Facebook React and Facebook Flux faces similar problems that you have (searching for how to combine Immutable with React and Flux may give you some good ideas)
